###### Create Gravatar Account
Uploading an avatar helps recognize you in your posts and across all the tools over the generic avatars used.  Signup for Free at [http://gravatar.com](http://gravatar.com) and upload an avatar.

It is highly recommended to add in two-factor authentication.  This requires your password to sign-in, then a random generated code from your mobile phone as the second layer.  This highly reduces hacking, phishing, or security risks to your account(s).
